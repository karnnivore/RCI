RCI - Created by Kevin Pei

RCI is a website project started in Fall 2013 in anticipation of the winter season.  This site is primarily dedicated to skiiers and boarders on the mountain.  It creates an interpersonal link between online users which hopefully, helps turn into real life interactions.  

This README file will contain a list of all committed files with a descriptive overview of each one.  Furthermore, the README file will constantly be updated with current and planned features.
